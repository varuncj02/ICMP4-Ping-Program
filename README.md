# SimplePing

## Description
This program takes in a website info and can theoretically keep pinging info from that website but for simplicity and to avoid getting banned it only pings the website four times returning data on the Packets received and if any loss over the network appeared.
Program Language: C , OS: Linux Ubuntu 14.04 Version

## Interesting Fact
Before writing this program, I had never worked with the C programming Language ever nor had I any idea about socket programming and networking in computers. Withing a week I brushed up C and learnt the basics of pinging, the ICMP protocol, and an introduction to Socket Programming
